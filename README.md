# Predicting-Flow-past-an-Obstacle-using-Diffusion-Models
G2F, a new diffusion-based generative model directly maps obstacle geometries to the corresponding steady-state flow fields. Building on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) framework, G2F conditions the reverse diffusion process on learned representations of obstacle shapes to facilitate geometry-guided flow generation..
